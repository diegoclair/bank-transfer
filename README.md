## 📝 Project
Bank Transer API
  
### Description :airplane:
The goal of this API is to simulate a bank.   
So you can create an account, do login and start to do transfers for other accounts.  
You can also see all transfers that you did and received.  
  
The API has some endpoints that you can use to see all accounts, an specified account, a balance of an account.

## ▶️ Start application 💻 

### ❗ First of all:
* You need to have docker installed in your computer.

### Start ▶️
To start the applciation, you need just to run the command `docker-compose up`. When you see this message `your server stated on [::]:5000` so your app is running correctly!

### 📝 Docs:
Inside of the `/docs` folder, you can see the Swagger documentation of the API Endpoints and a postman collection with this endpoints.

### Observations
- When you create an account, this account already start with 200 as balance, just to help to test the application.

## 💻 Tech  infos
- The architecture of files and folders was based on (DDD) domain driven design.
- We could add more tests as the project evolves to avoid errors.
